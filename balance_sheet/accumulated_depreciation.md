# Accumulated Depreciation [Accum Dep]

The total cumulative depreciation charged on a company's tangible fixed assets up to the date of the most recent balance sheet. Accumulated depreciation reflects the portion of a fixed asset’s cost that has been allocated to depreciation expense since the asset was acquired, representing reductions in asset value due to usage, wear and tear, age, or obsolescence.

## Formula
```text
Accumulated Depreciation = Sum of all depreciation expense taken on fixed assets to date
```

## Components
- **Included**: Depreciation expenses for all past years on all depreciable fixed assets (e.g., plant & machinery, buildings, equipment)
- **Excluded**: Depreciation for current year not yet recorded, amortization of intangible assets
- **Unit**: Rs. (Indian Rupees), usually shown as crores (Cr.)
- **Source**: Latest published balance sheet under “Fixed Assets” (typically as a negative balance or deducted from gross block)
- **Frequency**: Updated with every published financial report (quarterly/annually)

## Interpretation
| Movement           | Interpretation                                      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Increasing steadily| Normal for operating businesses with aging assets   |
| High vs peers      | Suggests older asset base or aggressive depreciation|
| Sudden jump        | Possible change in depreciation method or asset write-off|
| Negative balance   | Asset value net of accumulated depreciation         |

## Example
If a company purchased machinery for ₹100 crore five years ago and has charged ₹8 crore of depreciation every year, the **Accumulated Depreciation** after five years = ₹40 crore.

## Advantages
- Shows cumulative cost recovery of fixed assets over their useful life
- Critical for calculating **net block** (Gross Block – Accumulated Depreciation)
- Indicates age and usage of asset base
- Aids in comparison of asset quality and replacement needs across companies

## Limitations
- Does not reflect current market value of assets
- Depreciation methods and rates may differ across companies
- Not applicable to intangible assets (those are amortized)
- Changes in accounting policy can distort year-to-year comparability

## Industry Considerations
- **Capital-intensive industries** (e.g., manufacturing, telecom, utilities) have larger accumulated depreciation balances due to higher investments in fixed assets
- **Technology firms** may have lower values, reflecting higher intangible assets
- **Real estate** and **infrastructure** see gradual accumulation as assets are long-lived

## Related Metrics
- Net Block / Net Fixed Assets
- Gross Block
- Depreciation Expense (Annual)
- Asset Turnover Ratio

## Key Terms
- **Accumulated Depreciation**: Total of all periodic depreciation charges recorded against fixed assets since acquisition
- **Gross Block**: Original cost of fixed assets before depreciation
- **Net Block**: Value of fixed assets after deducting accumulated depreciation
- **Useful Life**: Expected period an asset will be productive for the company
- **Written Down Value (WDV)**: Book value of asset after accumulated depreciation

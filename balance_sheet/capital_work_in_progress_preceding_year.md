# Capital Work in Progress Preceding Year [CWIP PY]

The value of capital work in progress (CWIP) from the previous year's balance sheet, representing ongoing capital projects that were not yet completed at the end of the preceding financial year.

## Formula
```text
CWIP PY = Capital Work in Progress at the end of previous financial year
```

## Components
- **Included**: Construction in progress, machinery installation, plant setup, infrastructure development, and other capital projects
- **Excluded**: Completed assets, current year CWIP, revenue expenses, maintenance costs
- **Unit**: Rs.Cr. (Indian Rupees in Crores)
- **Frequency**: Updated annually with balance sheet reporting

## Interpretation
| Value Range | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| High relative to total assets | Significant ongoing capital expansion |
| Growing consistently | Company actively investing in capacity expansion |
| Declining | Projects being completed or capital spending reduced |
| Zero or minimal | No major capital projects in progress |
| High volatility | Irregular capital spending patterns |

## Example
If a company's previous year balance sheet shows:
- Plant construction: ₹200 Cr
- Machinery installation: ₹150 Cr
- Infrastructure development: ₹100 Cr
- **Capital Work in Progress PY: ₹450 Cr**

## Advantages
- **Growth Indicator**: Shows company's expansion plans and execution
- **Capacity Building**: Indicates future production capabilities
- **Investment Tracking**: Helps monitor capital allocation efficiency
- **Future Revenue**: Completed projects will generate future income
- **Competitive Position**: Reflects investment in infrastructure and technology

## Limitations
- **Historical Data**: Represents past year's position, not current status
- **Completion Uncertainty**: Projects may be delayed or abandoned
- **Cost Overruns**: Final costs may exceed initial estimates
- **Technology Risk**: Projects may become obsolete before completion
- **Cash Flow Impact**: High CWIP indicates significant cash outflows

## Industry Considerations
- **Manufacturing**: High CWIP due to plant and machinery projects
- **Infrastructure**: Significant ongoing construction projects
- **Technology**: Moderate CWIP for facility and equipment upgrades
- **Real Estate**: High CWIP for development projects
- **Banking**: Minimal CWIP, mainly IT infrastructure

# Face value [Face value]

Face value or nominal value of the company's equity shares - represents the original value assigned to each share when it was first issued, serving as the base value for accounting and legal purposes regardless of current market price.

## Formula
```text
Face Value = Equity Capital ÷ Number of Shares
```

## Components
- **Included**: Original issue price per share, nominal value
- **Excluded**: Market price, premium, discount, book value
- **Unit**: Rs. (Indian Rupees)
- **Frequency**: Fixed at issue, rarely changes

## Interpretation
| Face Value | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| High vs Market Price | Stock trading at premium |
| Low vs Market Price | Stock trading at discount |
| Equal to Market Price | Stock trading at par |

# Net block [Net Block]

Net block excluding CWIP from the latest balance sheet - represents the net value of fixed assets after depreciation, excluding capital work in progress, reflecting the company's current productive asset base and providing insight into asset utilization and capital efficiency.

## Formula
```text
Net Block = Gross Block - Accumulated Depreciation - Capital Work in Progress
```

## Components
- **Included**: Land, buildings, plant & machinery, equipment, vehicles (net of depreciation)
- **Excluded**: Current assets, investments, intangible assets, capital work in progress
- **Unit**: Rs.Cr. (Crores)
- **Frequency**: Updated quarterly with balance sheet

## Interpretation
| Asset Level | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| High vs Revenue | Capital intensive business model |
| Low vs Revenue | Asset light business model |
| Growing | Active capital investment program |
| Stable | Mature asset base maintenance |
| Declining | Asset disposal or divestment |

## Example
If a company's net block shows:
- Land: ₹200 Cr
- Buildings (Net): ₹500 Cr
- Plant & Machinery (Net): ₹800 Cr
- Equipment (Net): ₹100 Cr
- **Total Net Block: ₹1,600 Cr**

## Advantages

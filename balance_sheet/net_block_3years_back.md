# Net block 3Years back [Net Block 3Yrs Back]

Net block of fixed assets 3 years back - represents the net value of fixed assets after depreciation as of 3 years ago, providing a historical baseline for asset value analysis and depreciation trend assessment over a medium-term period.

## Formula
```text
Net Block 3Yrs Back = Gross Block - Accumulated Depreciation (3 years ago)
```

## Components
- **Included**: Land, buildings, plant & machinery, equipment, vehicles (net of depreciation)
- **Excluded**: Current assets, investments, intangible assets, accumulated depreciation
- **Unit**: Rs.Cr. (Crores)
- **Frequency**: Annual (as of 3 years back)

## Interpretation
| Asset Level | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| High vs Current | Significant asset addition or lower depreciation |
| Low vs Current | Asset disposal or higher depreciation |
| Stable | Consistent asset management |
| Growing | Regular capital investment program |
| Declining | Asset aging or divestment strategy |

## Example
If a company's net block 3 years ago shows:
- Land: ₹200 Cr
- Buildings (Net): ₹400 Cr
- Plant & Machinery (Net): ₹600 Cr
- Equipment (Net): ₹80 Cr
- **Total Net Block 3Yrs Back: ₹1,280 Cr**

## Advantages
- Historical asset value reference
- Depreciation trend analysis
- Asset growth pattern identification
- Capital investment tracking
- Asset efficiency assessment

## Limitations
- Historical data, not current
- Doesn't show asset condition
- May not reflect market value
- Doesn't include recent investments
- May not show asset utilization

## Industry Considerations
- **Manufacturing**: High net block due to plant & machinery
- **Infrastructure**: Very high net block for projects
- **Technology**: Lower net block, focus on intangibles
- **Banking**: Moderate net block, focus on branches
- **Real Estate**: High net block for land and buildings

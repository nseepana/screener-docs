# Net block 5Years back [Net Block 5Yrs Back]

Net block of fixed assets 5 years back - represents the net value of fixed assets after depreciation as of 5 years ago, providing a longer-term historical baseline for asset value analysis and capital investment trend assessment.

## Formula
```text
Net Block 5Yrs Back = Gross Block - Accumulated Depreciation (5 years ago)
```

## Components
- **Included**: Land, buildings, plant & machinery, equipment, vehicles (net of depreciation)
- **Excluded**: Current assets, investments, intangible assets, accumulated depreciation
- **Unit**: Rs.Cr. (Crores)
- **Frequency**: Annual (as of 5 years back)

## Interpretation
| Asset Level | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| High vs Current | Major asset addition or lower depreciation over 5 years |
| Low vs Current | Asset disposal or higher depreciation over 5 years |
| Stable | Consistent long-term asset management |
| Growing | Sustained capital investment program |
| Declining | Asset aging or strategic divestment |

## Example
If a company's net block 5 years ago shows:
- Land: ₹150 Cr
- Buildings (Net): ₹300 Cr
- Plant & Machinery (Net): ₹400 Cr
- Equipment (Net): ₹50 Cr
- **Total Net Block 5Yrs Back: ₹900 Cr**

## Advantages
- Long-term asset value reference
- Depreciation trend analysis over 5 years
- Asset growth pattern identification
- Capital investment tracking
- Strategic asset management insights

## Limitations
- Historical data, not current
- Doesn't show asset condition
- May not reflect market value
- Doesn't include recent investments
- May not show asset utilization

## Industry Considerations
- **Manufacturing**: High net block due to plant & machinery
- **Infrastructure**: Very high net block for projects
- **Technology**: Lower net block, focus on intangibles
- **Banking**: Moderate net block, focus on branches
- **Real Estate**: High net block for land and buildings

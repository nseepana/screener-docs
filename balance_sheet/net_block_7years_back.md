# Net block 7Years back [Net Block 7Yrs Back]

Net block of fixed assets 7 years back - represents the net value of fixed assets after depreciation as of 7 years ago, providing an extended historical baseline for comprehensive asset value analysis and long-term capital investment trend assessment.

## Formula
```text
Net Block 7Yrs Back = Gross Block - Accumulated Depreciation (7 years ago)
```

## Components
- **Included**: Land, buildings, plant & machinery, equipment, vehicles (net of depreciation)
- **Excluded**: Current assets, investments, intangible assets, accumulated depreciation
- **Unit**: Rs.Cr. (Crores)
- **Frequency**: Annual (as of 7 years back)

## Interpretation
| Asset Level | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| High vs Current | Substantial asset addition or lower depreciation over 7 years |
| Low vs Current | Asset disposal or higher depreciation over 7 years |
| Stable | Consistent long-term asset management |
| Growing | Sustained capital investment program |
| Declining | Asset aging or strategic divestment |

## Example
If a company's net block 7 years ago shows:
- Land: ₹120 Cr
- Buildings (Net): ₹250 Cr
- Plant & Machinery (Net): ₹350 Cr
- Equipment (Net): ₹40 Cr
- **Total Net Block 7Yrs Back: ₹760 Cr**

## Advantages

- **Banking**: Moderate net block, focus on branches
- **Real Estate**: High net block for land and buildings

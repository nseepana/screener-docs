# Net block preceding year [Net Block PY]

Net block of fixed assets from the preceding year - represents the net value of fixed assets after depreciation as of the previous financial year, providing a recent historical baseline for asset value analysis and year-over-year comparison of capital investment trends.

## Formula
```text
Net Block PY = Gross Block - Accumulated Depreciation (Previous Year)
```

## Components
- **Included**: Land, buildings, plant & machinery, equipment, vehicles (net of depreciation)
- **Excluded**: Current assets, investments, intangible assets, accumulated depreciation
- **Unit**: Rs.Cr. (Crores)
- **Frequency**: Annual (as of previous year end)

## Interpretation
| Asset Level | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| High vs Current | Asset addition or lower depreciation in current year |
| Low vs Current | Asset disposal or higher depreciation in current year |
| Stable | Consistent asset management year-over-year |
| Growing | Regular capital investment program |
| Declining | Asset aging or divestment strategy |

## Example
If a company's net block in the preceding year shows:
- Land: ₹180 Cr
- Buildings (Net): ₹450 Cr
- Plant & Machinery (Net): ₹700 Cr
- Equipment (Net): ₹90 Cr
- **Total Net Block PY: ₹1,420 Cr**

## Advantages
- Recent historical asset value reference
- Year-over-year depreciation analysis
- Asset growth pattern identification
- Capital investment tracking
- Asset efficiency assessment

## Limitations
- Historical data, not current
- Doesn't show asset condition
- May not reflect market value
- Doesn't include current year investments
- May not show asset utilization

## Industry Considerations
- **Manufacturing**: High net block due to plant & machinery
- **Infrastructure**: Very high net block for projects
- **Technology**: Lower net block, focus on intangibles
- **Banking**: Moderate net block, focus on branches
- **Real Estate**: High net block for land and buildings

## Best Practices
- Compare with current net block for growth analysis
- Analyze year-over-year depreciation patterns
- Consider industry capital intensity
- Monitor capital expenditure trends
- Evaluate asset utilization efficiency

# Number of equity shares preceding year [No. Eq. Shares PY]

Number of equity shares at the end of the preceding financial year - represents the total count of outstanding equity shares as of the previous year end, providing a historical baseline for share count analysis and year-over-year comparison of ownership structure changes.

## Formula
```text
No. Eq. Shares PY = Total Outstanding Equity Shares (Previous Year End)
```

## Components
- **Included**: Issued and outstanding equity shares, fully paid shares
- **Excluded**: Treasury shares, preference shares, unissued shares, partly paid shares
- **Unit**: Cr. (Crores)
- **Frequency**: Annual (as of previous year end)

## Interpretation
| Share Count | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| High vs Current | Share dilution or stock split in current year |
| Low vs Current | Share buyback or reverse split in current year |
| Stable | No significant changes in ownership structure |
| Growing | Regular equity issuance or bonus shares |
| Declining | Share buyback program or consolidation |

## Example
If a company's equity shares in the preceding year show:
- Authorized Capital: 20 Cr shares
- Issued Capital: 15 Cr shares
- **Outstanding Shares PY: 15 Cr shares**

## Advantages
- Historical share count reference
- Year-over-year ownership analysis
- Dilution impact assessment
- EPS calculation baseline
- Ownership structure tracking

## Limitations
- Historical data, not current
- Doesn't show share price impact
- May not reflect recent changes
- Doesn't include treasury shares
- May not show voting rights

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: Stable share count due to regulatory requirements
- **Technology**: Variable share count due to ESOPs and growth
- **Infrastructure**: Moderate share count changes
- **FMCG**: Generally stable share count
- **Startups**: High share count volatility

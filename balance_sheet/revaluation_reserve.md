# Revaluation reserve [Reval Resv]

Revaluation reserve from the latest balance sheet - represents the surplus arising from the upward revaluation of fixed assets to their current market value, reflecting unrealized gains on asset appreciation and providing insight into the company's asset value adjustments.

## Formula
```text
Reval Resv = Revalued Asset Value - Original Asset Value (Net of Depreciation)
```

## Components
- **Included**: Upward revaluation of land, buildings, plant & machinery, equipment
- **Excluded**: Downward revaluation, current assets, investments, intangible assets
- **Unit**: Rs.Cr. (Crores)
- **Frequency**: Updated when revaluation is performed

## Interpretation
| Reserve Level | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------------|
| High vs Assets | Significant asset appreciation, strong asset base |
| Low vs Assets | Minimal revaluation or asset depreciation |
| Growing | Regular asset revaluation or appreciation |
| Declining | Asset depreciation or revaluation reversal |
| Stable | No recent revaluation activity |

## Example
If a company's revaluation reserve shows:
- Land Revaluation: ₹50 Cr
- Building Revaluation: ₹30 Cr
- Plant & Machinery Revaluation: ₹20 Cr
- **Total Revaluation Reserve: ₹100 Cr**

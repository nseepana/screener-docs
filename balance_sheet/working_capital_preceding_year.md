# Working capital preceding year [Work Cap PY]

Working capital from the preceding year - represents the net working capital (current assets minus current liabilities and short-term borrowings) as of the previous financial year, providing a recent historical baseline for year-over-year working capital trend analysis and operational efficiency assessment.

## Formula
```text
Work Cap PY = Current Assets - Current Liabilities - Short-term Borrowings (Previous Year)
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current assets, current liabilities, short-term borrowings
- **Excluded**: Fixed assets, long-term debt, equity, reserves
- **Unit**: Rs.Cr. (Crores)
- **Frequency**: Annual (as of previous year end)

## Interpretation
| Working Capital Level | Interpretation |
|----------------------|----------------|
| High vs Current | Improved working capital management |
| Low vs Current | Deteriorating working capital or increased short-term debt |
| Positive | Adequate short-term liquidity |
| Negative | Potential liquidity stress |
| Growing | Better operational efficiency |

## Example
If a company's working capital in the preceding year shows:
- Current Assets: ₹600 Cr
- Current Liabilities: ₹350 Cr
- Short-term Borrowings: ₹120 Cr
- **Working Capital PY: ₹130 Cr**

## Advantages

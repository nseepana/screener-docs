Each criterion scores a point if met, summing up to a maximum of 9. A higher Piotroski score signals stronger fundamentals, while a lower score suggests possible financial distress. The nine criteria fall under three main categories: Profitability (net income, operating cash flow, ROA, accruals), Leverage/Liquidity (change in leverage, change in current ratio, absence of share dilution), and Operating Efficiency (gross margin and asset turnover improvements). Investors use this widely to refine stock screens and identify turnaround opportunities.",

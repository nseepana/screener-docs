# Average Return on Equity 3 Years [ROE 3Yrs]

## Definition
The average return on equity (ROE) over the past three financial years, weighted by each year's contribution. This metric shows how effectively a company has used shareholders' equity to generate profits during this period.

## Formula
```text
Average ROE 3 Years = (ROE Year 1 + ROE Year 2 + ROE Year 3) / 3
```

## Components
- **Included**: Net profit, Shareholders' equity from 3 consecutive years
- **Excluded**: Extraordinary items, one-time gains/losses
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated annually with financial results

## Interpretation
| ROE Range | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| > 20%     | Excellent profitability and efficiency |
| 15-20%    | Good profitability |
| 10-15%    | Average profitability |
| 5-10%     | Below average |
| < 5%      | Poor profitability |

## Example
If a company's ROE over 3 years is:
- Year 1: 17%
- Year 2: 14%
- Year 3: 19%

**Average ROE 3 Years = (17 + 14 + 19) / 3 = 16.7%**

## Advantages
- Shows recent profitability trend
- Indicates management efficiency
- Useful for short- to medium-term analysis
- Reduces impact of one-time events

## Limitations
- May mask year-to-year fluctuations
- Does not reflect longer-term business cycles
- Can be skewed by sudden equity changes
- May not show current performance fully

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: Higher ROE due to leverage
- **Technology**: Variable ROE, especially in growth phases
- **Utilities**: Lower but stable ROE
- **Manufacturing**: Moderate ROE with business cycles

# Average Return on Equity 5 Years [ROE 5Yr]

## Definition
The average return on equity (ROE) over the past five financial years, weighted by each year's contribution. This metric indicates how effectively a company has used shareholders' equity to generate profits during this period.

## Formula
```text
Average ROE 5 Years = (ROE Year 1 + ROE Year 2 + ROE Year 3 + ROE Year 4 + ROE Year 5) / 5
```

## Components
- **Included**: Net profit, Shareholders' equity from 5 consecutive years
- **Excluded**: Extraordinary items, one-time gains/losses
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated annually with financial results

## Interpretation
| ROE Range | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| > 20% | Excellent profitability and efficiency |
| 15-20% | Good profitability |
| 10-15% | Average profitability |
| 5-10% | Below average |
| < 5% | Poor profitability |

## Example
If a company's ROE over 5 years is:
- Year 1: 18%
- Year 2: 22%
- Year 3: 15%
- Year 4: 20%
- Year 5: 19%

**Average ROE 5 Years = (18 + 22 + 15 + 20 + 19) / 5 = 18.8%**

## Advantages
- Shows consistent profitability trend
- Indicates management efficiency
- Useful for long-term analysis
- Reduces impact of one-time events

## Limitations
- May mask recent performance changes
- Doesn't show year-to-year volatility
- Can be skewed by equity changes
- May not reflect current business conditions

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: Higher ROE due to leverage
- **Technology**: Variable ROE based on growth stage
- **Utilities**: Lower but stable ROE
- **Manufacturing**: Moderate ROE with cycles

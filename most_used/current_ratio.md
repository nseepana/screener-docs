# Current Ratio [Current ratio]


Current Ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its current assets. It indicates the company's short-term financial health and liquidity position.

## Formula
```text
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
```

## Components
- **Included**: Cash, accounts receivable, inventory, short-term investments
- **Excluded**: Long-term assets, long-term liabilities
- **Unit**: Ratio (times)
- **Frequency**: Calculated quarterly and annually

## Interpretation
| Current Ratio | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------------|
| > 2.0 | Excellent liquidity, may indicate inefficient asset use |
| 1.5-2.0 | Good liquidity position |
| 1.0-1.5 | Adequate liquidity |
| < 1.0 | Poor liquidity, potential solvency issues |

## Example
If a company has:
- Current Assets: ₹500 Cr
- Current Liabilities: ₹300 Cr

**Current Ratio = ₹500 Cr / ₹300 Cr = 1.67 times**

## Advantages
- Simple liquidity measure
- Indicates short-term solvency
- Easy to calculate and understand
- Widely used by creditors

## Limitations
- Doesn't consider asset quality
- May include slow-moving inventory
- Doesn't reflect cash flow timing
- Industry-specific variations

## Industry Considerations
- **Manufacturing**: Higher ratios due to inventory
- **Technology**: Lower ratios, cash-rich
- **Retail**: Variable ratios, seasonal patterns
- **Banking**: Different liquidity metrics

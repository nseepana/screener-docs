# Debt [Debt]


Total Debt represents the sum of all borrowings and financial obligations of a company as per the latest annual financial statements. It includes both short-term and long-term debt.

## Formula
```text
Total Debt = Short-term Debt + Long-term Debt
```

## Components
- **Included**: Bank loans, bonds, debentures, commercial paper, other borrowings
- **Excluded**: Trade payables, accrued expenses, operating leases
- **Unit**: Rs. Crores
- **Frequency**: Updated annually with financial statements

## Interpretation
| Debt Level | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| High Debt | Increased financial risk, higher interest burden |
| Moderate Debt | Balanced capital structure |
| Low Debt | Conservative approach, lower risk |
| No Debt | Debt-free, but may miss growth opportunities |

## Example
If a company has:
- Short-term Debt: ₹200 Cr
- Long-term Debt: ₹800 Cr

**Total Debt = ₹200 Cr + ₹800 Cr = ₹1,000 Cr**

# Debt to Equity


Debt-to-Equity ratio measures the relative proportion of shareholders' equity and debt used to finance a company's assets. It indicates the company's financial leverage and risk level.

## Formula
```text
Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Shareholders' Equity
```

## Components
- **Included**: Total debt (short-term + long-term), total shareholders' equity
- **Excluded**: Operating leases (in some cases), contingent liabilities
- **Unit**: Ratio (times)
- **Frequency**: Calculated quarterly and annually

## Interpretation
| D/E Ratio | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| < 0.5 | Conservative, low risk |
| 0.5-1.0 | Moderate leverage |
| 1.0-2.0 | High leverage, higher risk |
| > 2.0 | Very high leverage, high risk |

## Example
If a company has:
- Total Debt: ₹200 Cr
- Total Shareholders' Equity: ₹300 Cr

**Debt-to-Equity Ratio = ₹200 Cr / ₹300 Cr = 0.67 times**

## Advantages
- Indicates financial risk level
- Shows capital structure efficiency
- Useful for credit analysis

## Limitations
- Industry-specific variations
- Doesn't consider debt quality

- Can be manipulated through accounting

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: High D/E due to business model
- **Technology**: Low D/E, cash-rich
- **Manufacturing**: Moderate D/E, capital intensive
- **Utilities**: High D/E, stable cash flows

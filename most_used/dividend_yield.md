# Dividend Yield [Div Yld]


Dividend Yield represents the annual dividend payment as a percentage of the current stock price. It indicates the return on investment from dividends alone, excluding special dividends.

## Formula
```text
Dividend Yield = (Annual Dividend per Share / Current Stock Price) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Regular annual dividends per share, current stock price
- **Excluded**: Special dividends, one-time payouts
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated with price changes and dividend announcements

## Interpretation
| Dividend Yield | Interpretation |
|----------------|----------------|
| > 5% | High yield, income-focused investment |
| 3-5% | Good yield, balanced return |
| 1-3% | Moderate yield, growth focus |
| < 1% | Low yield, growth-oriented |
| 0% | No dividends, reinvestment focus |

## Example
If a company has:
- Annual Dividend per Share: ₹50
- Current Stock Price: ₹1,000

**Dividend Yield = (₹50 / ₹1,000) × 100 = 5%**

## Advantages
- Indicates income generation
- Shows shareholder returns
- Useful for income investors

## Limitations

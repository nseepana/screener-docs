# Earnings Yield


Earnings Yield represents the earnings generated per unit of enterprise value. It's calculated as trailing EBIT divided by enterprise value, providing an inverse perspective to valuation ratios.

## Formula
```text
Earnings Yield = (Trailing EBIT / Enterprise Value) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Trailing 12 months EBIT, enterprise value
- **Excluded**: Non-operating income, extraordinary items
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated with earnings and market data

## Interpretation
| Earnings Yield | Interpretation |
|----------------|----------------|
| > 10% | High yield, potentially undervalued |
| 5-10% | Moderate yield, fair value |
| 3-5% | Low yield, premium valuation |
| < 3% | Very low yield, potentially overvalued |

## Example
If a company has:
- Trailing EBIT: ₹500 Cr
- Enterprise Value: ₹5,000 Cr

**Earnings Yield = (₹500 Cr / ₹5,000 Cr) × 100 = 10%**

## Advantages
- Inverse of EV/EBIT ratio
- Easy to understand
- Useful for comparing companies
- Indicates return on investment

## Limitations
- Doesn't account for growth
- May not reflect cash generation
- Industry-specific variations
- Can be volatile

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: Lower yields due to leverage
- **Technology**: Variable yields, growth focus
- **Manufacturing**: Moderate yields, cyclical
- **Utilities**: Lower yields, regulated returns

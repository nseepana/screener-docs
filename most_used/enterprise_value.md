# Enterprise Value [EV]


Enterprise Value (EV) represents the total value of a company, including both equity and debt, minus cash and cash equivalents. It provides a more comprehensive valuation than market capitalization alone.

## Formula
```text
Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Total Debt - Cash and Cash Equivalents
```

## Components
- **Included**: Market capitalization, total debt, cash and cash equivalents
- **Excluded**: Preferred stock (in some calculations)
- **Unit**: Rs. Crores
- **Frequency**: Updated with market price changes

## Interpretation
| EV vs Market Cap | Interpretation |
|------------------|----------------|
| EV > Market Cap | High debt, low cash |
| EV < Market Cap | Low debt, high cash |
| EV = Market Cap | Balanced capital structure |

## Example
If a company has:
- Market Cap: ₹5,000 Cr
- Total Debt: ₹1,000 Cr
- Cash: ₹500 Cr

**Enterprise Value = ₹5,000 + ₹1,000 - ₹500 = ₹5,500 Cr**

## Advantages
- More comprehensive valuation
- Accounts for capital structure
- Useful for M&A analysis
- Better for comparing companies

## Limitations
- More complex calculation
- Requires debt and cash data
- Can be volatile
- May not reflect true value

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: High EV due to leverage
- **Technology**: Lower EV, cash-rich
- **Manufacturing**: Moderate EV, capital intensive
- **Utilities**: High EV, stable cash flows

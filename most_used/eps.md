# Earnings Per Share


Earnings Per Share (EPS) represents the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. It's calculated by dividing net profit by the number of outstanding shares.

## Formula
```text
EPS = (Net Profit - Preferred Dividends) / Average Outstanding Shares
```

## Components
- **Included**: Net profit after tax, average outstanding shares
- **Excluded**: Preferred dividends, extraordinary items
- **Unit**: Rs. per share
- **Frequency**: Calculated quarterly and annually

## Interpretation
| EPS Range | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| High & Growing | Strong profitability, good investment |
| High & Stable | Mature company, consistent returns |
| Low & Declining | Poor performance, avoid |
| Negative | Loss-making company |

## Example
If a company has:
- Net Profit: ₹100 Cr
- Preferred Dividends: ₹10 Cr
- Average Outstanding Shares: 5 Cr shares

**EPS = (₹100 Cr - ₹10 Cr) / 5 Cr = ₹18 per share**

## Advantages
- Easy to understand and compare

## Limitations

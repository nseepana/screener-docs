# EV/EBITDA


EV/EBITDA ratio compares a company's enterprise value to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. It's a popular valuation metric that accounts for capital structure and operating performance.

## Formula
```text
EV/EBITDA = Enterprise Value / EBITDA
```

## Components
- **Included**: Enterprise value, EBITDA (trailing 12 months)
- **Excluded**: Non-operating income, extraordinary items
- **Unit**: Multiple (times)
- **Frequency**: Updated with market and earnings data

## Interpretation
| EV/EBITDA Range | Interpretation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| < 8 | Potentially undervalued |
| 8-15 | Fair value range |
| 15-25 | Premium valuation |
| > 25 | High premium, potentially overvalued |

## Example
If a company has:
- Enterprise Value: ₹6,000 Cr
- EBITDA: ₹400 Cr

**EV/EBITDA = ₹6,000 Cr / ₹400 Cr = 15 times**

## Advantages
- Accounts for capital structure
- Useful for comparing companies
- Less affected by accounting differences

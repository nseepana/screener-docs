# Industry PE [Ind PE]


Industry PE represents the average price-to-earnings ratio of companies within the same industry sector. It provides a benchmark for comparing individual company valuations against industry standards.

## Formula
```text
Industry PE = Average of (Market Cap / Net Profit) for all companies in the industry
```

## Components
- **Included**: Market capitalization, net profit of industry peers
- **Excluded**: Outliers, companies with negative earnings
- **Unit**: Multiple (times)
- **Frequency**: Updated with market and earnings data

## Interpretation
| Company PE vs Industry PE | Interpretation |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| Company PE < Industry PE | Potentially undervalued relative to peers |
| Company PE = Industry PE | Fairly valued relative to peers |
| Company PE > Industry PE | Potentially overvalued relative to peers |

## Example
If the industry average shows:
- Industry PE: 18
- Company PE: 15

**Company is trading at a discount to industry average**

## Advantages
- Provides industry context
- Useful for relative valuation
- Helps identify outliers
- Industry-specific benchmarks

## Limitations
- May not reflect growth differences
- Can be skewed by outliers
- Doesn't account for quality differences
- Industry definitions may vary

## Industry Considerations
- **Technology**: Higher PE due to growth
- **Banking**: Lower PE due to regulations
- **Manufacturing**: Moderate PE, cyclical
- **Utilities**: Lower PE, stable returns

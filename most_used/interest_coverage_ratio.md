# Interest Coverage Ratio [Int Coverage]


Interest Coverage Ratio measures a company's ability to pay interest on its outstanding debt using its operating earnings. It indicates the company's financial strength and debt servicing capability.

## Formula
```text
Interest Coverage Ratio = EBIT / Interest Expense
```

## Components
- **Included**: Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), interest expense
- **Excluded**: Non-operating income, extraordinary items
- **Unit**: Ratio (times)
- **Frequency**: Calculated quarterly and annually

## Interpretation
| Interest Coverage | Interpretation |
|-------------------|----------------|
| > 5.0 | Excellent debt servicing ability |
| 3.0-5.0 | Good debt servicing ability |
| 2.0-3.0 | Adequate debt servicing ability |
| 1.0-2.0 | Poor debt servicing ability |
| < 1.0 | Cannot cover interest payments |

## Example
If a company has:
- EBIT: ₹200 Cr
- Interest Expense: ₹50 Cr

**Interest Coverage Ratio = ₹200 Cr / ₹50 Cr = 4.0 times**

## Advantages
- Indicates debt servicing capacity
- Shows financial stability
- Useful for credit analysis
- Easy to calculate

## Limitations
- Doesn't consider principal payments
- May not reflect cash flow timing
- Can be manipulated through accounting
- Industry-specific variations

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: Different metrics due to business model
- **Technology**: High ratios, low debt
- **Manufacturing**: Moderate ratios, capital intensive
- **Utilities**: Lower ratios, stable cash flows

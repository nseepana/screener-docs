# Market Capitalization


Market Capitalization represents the total market value of a company's outstanding shares at the current market price. It's calculated by multiplying the current stock price by the total number of outstanding shares.

## Formula
```text
Market Cap = Current Stock Price × Total Outstanding Shares
```

## Components
- **Included**: All outstanding common shares, current market price
- **Excluded**: Preferred shares, treasury stock, employee stock options
- **Unit**: Rs. Crores
- **Frequency**: Updated continuously during trading hours

## Interpretation
| Market Cap Range | Company Size | Risk Profile |
|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| > ₹1,00,000 Cr | Large Cap | Lower risk, stable |
| ₹20,000-1,00,000 Cr | Mid Cap | Moderate risk |
| ₹5,000-20,000 Cr | Small Cap | Higher risk, growth potential |
| < ₹5,000 Cr | Micro Cap | Highest risk, volatile |

## Example
If a company has:
- Current Stock Price: ₹500
- Total Outstanding Shares: 10,00,00,000 (10 Cr shares)

**Market Cap = ₹500 × 10 Cr = ₹5,000 Cr**

## Advantages
- Indicates company size and market presence
- Used for index inclusion criteria
- Helps in portfolio diversification

## Limitations
- Doesn't reflect company's intrinsic value

## Industry Considerations

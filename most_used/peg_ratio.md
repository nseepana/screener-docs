# PEG Ratio


Price/Earnings to Growth (PEG) ratio compares a company's P/E ratio to its earnings growth rate. It helps identify whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued relative to its growth prospects.

## Formula
```text
PEG Ratio = P/E Ratio / Annual Earnings Growth Rate
```

## Components
- **Included**: P/E ratio, earnings growth rate (typically 3-year)
- **Excluded**: One-time earnings spikes, extraordinary items
- **Unit**: Multiple (times)
- **Frequency**: Updated with price and earnings changes

## Interpretation
| PEG Ratio | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| < 1.0 | Potentially undervalued relative to growth |
| 1.0 | Fairly valued relative to growth |
| 1.0-2.0 | Slightly overvalued relative to growth |
| > 2.0 | Overvalued relative to growth |

## Example
If a company has:
- P/E Ratio: 20
- 3-Year Earnings Growth Rate: 15%

**PEG Ratio = 20 / 15 = 1.33**

## Advantages
- Accounts for growth in valuation
- Better than P/E alone
- Useful for growth stocks
- Helps identify value opportunities

## Limitations
- Relies on historical growth
- Growth may not be sustainable
- Can be misleading for cyclical companies
- Requires accurate growth projections

## Industry Considerations
- **Technology**: Variable PEG due to growth cycles
- **Banking**: Lower PEG due to stable growth
- **Manufacturing**: Cyclical PEG patterns
- **FMCG**: Consistent PEG, stable growth

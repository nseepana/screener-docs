# Pledged Percentage


Pledged Percentage represents the proportion of promoter shares that have been pledged as collateral for loans or other financial obligations. It indicates the financial leverage of promoters and potential risk.

## Formula
```text
Pledged Percentage = (Pledged Promoter Shares / Total Promoter Shares) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Promoter shares pledged as collateral
- **Excluded**: Unpledged promoter shares, public shares
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated with shareholding filings

## Interpretation
| Pledged Percentage | Interpretation |
|-------------------|----------------|
| 0% | No pledged shares, low risk |
| 1-25% | Low pledged percentage, manageable risk |
| 25-50% | Moderate pledged percentage, increased risk |
| > 50% | High pledged percentage, high risk |

## Example
If a company has:
- Total Promoter Shares: 10 Cr
- Pledged Shares: 3 Cr

**Pledged Percentage = (3 Cr / 10 Cr) × 100 = 30%**

## Advantages
- Indicates promoter financial stress
- Shows potential risk level

## Limitations

- Can be misleading if small amounts
- Doesn't consider loan quality

## Industry Considerations

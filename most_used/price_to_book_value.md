# Price to Book Value [CMP / BV]


Price-to-Book Value (P/B) ratio compares a company's current market price per share to its book value per share. It indicates whether a stock is trading at a premium or discount to its book value.

## Formula
```text
P/B Ratio = Current Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current market price, book value per share
- **Excluded**: Intangible assets (in some calculations)
- **Unit**: Multiple (times)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily with price changes

## Interpretation
| P/B Ratio | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| < 1.0 | Trading below book value, potentially undervalued |
| 1.0-2.0 | Fair value range |
| 2.0-3.0 | Trading at premium to book value |
| > 3.0 | High premium, potentially overvalued |

## Example
If a company has:
- Current Stock Price: ₹1,500
- Book Value per Share: ₹1,000

**P/B Ratio = ₹1,500 / ₹1,000 = 1.5 times**

## Advantages
- Simple valuation metric
- Indicates asset backing
- Useful for asset-heavy companies
- Less volatile than P/E ratio

## Limitations
- Doesn't account for intangible assets
- May not reflect true value
- Industry-specific variations
- Book value can be outdated

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: Lower P/B due to regulatory constraints
- **Technology**: Higher P/B due to intangible assets
- **Manufacturing**: Moderate P/B, asset-heavy
- **Utilities**: Lower P/B, regulated returns

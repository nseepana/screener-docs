# Price to Earnings


Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio compares a company's current market price per share to its earnings per share. It indicates how much investors are willing to pay for each rupee of earnings.

## Formula
```text
P/E Ratio = Current Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share (EPS)
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current market price, trailing 12 months earnings per share
- **Excluded**: Extraordinary items, one-time gains/losses
- **Unit**: Multiple (times)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily with price changes

## Interpretation
| P/E Range | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| < 10 | Potentially undervalued or declining earnings |
| 10-15 | Fair value range |
| 15-25 | Growth expectations |
| 25-40 | High growth expectations |
| > 40 | Overvalued or exceptional growth |

## Example
If a company has:
- Current Stock Price: ₹1,000
- Earnings per Share: ₹50

**P/E Ratio = ₹1,000 / ₹50 = 20 times**

## Advantages
- Easy to understand and calculate
- Widely used for valuation
- Helps compare companies
- Indicates market expectations

## Limitations
- Doesn't account for growth rates
- Can be misleading for cyclical companies
- Doesn't consider debt levels
- Earnings can be manipulated

## Industry Considerations
- **Technology**: Higher P/E due to growth potential
- **Banking**: Lower P/E due to regulatory constraints
- **Utilities**: Moderate P/E, stable earnings
- **FMCG**: Consistent P/E, defensive nature

# Price to Free Cash Flow [CMP / FCF]


Price-to-Free Cash Flow (P/FCF) ratio compares a company's current stock price to its free cash flow per share. It indicates how much investors are willing to pay for each rupee of free cash flow generated.

## Formula
```text
P/FCF Ratio = Current Stock Price / Free Cash Flow per Share
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current stock price, average free cash flow per share (3-year)
- **Excluded**: Non-cash items, one-time cash flows
- **Unit**: Multiple (times)
- **Frequency**: Updated with price changes

## Interpretation
| P/FCF Ratio | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| < 10 | Potentially undervalued |
| 10-20 | Fair value range |
| 20-30 | Premium valuation |
| > 30 | High premium, potentially overvalued |

## Example
If a company has:
- Current Stock Price: ₹1,000
- Average FCF per Share: ₹50

**P/FCF Ratio = ₹1,000 / ₹50 = 20 times**

## Advantages
- Focuses on cash generation
- Less susceptible to accounting manipulation
- Indicates true profitability
- Useful for dividend analysis

## Limitations
- Can be volatile year-to-year
- May not reflect growth potential
- Industry-specific variations
- Requires consistent cash flow

## Industry Considerations
- **Technology**: Variable ratios due to growth
- **Banking**: Different metrics due to business model
- **Manufacturing**: Moderate ratios, cyclical
- **Utilities**: Lower ratios, stable cash flows

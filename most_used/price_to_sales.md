# Price to Sales [CMP / Sales]


Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio compares a company's market capitalization to its revenue. It indicates how much investors are willing to pay for each rupee of sales generated by the company.

## Formula
```text
P/S Ratio = Market Cap / Total Revenue
```

## Components
- **Included**: Market capitalization, total revenue
- **Excluded**: Non-operating revenue, extraordinary items
- **Unit**: Multiple (times)
- **Frequency**: Updated with price changes

## Interpretation
| P/S Ratio | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| < 1.0 | Potentially undervalued |
| 1.0-3.0 | Fair value range |
| 3.0-5.0 | Premium valuation |
| > 5.0 | High premium, potentially overvalued |

## Example
If a company has:
- Market Cap: ₹5,000 Cr
- Total Revenue: ₹2,000 Cr

**P/S Ratio = ₹5,000 Cr / ₹2,000 Cr = 2.5 times**

## Advantages
- Useful for unprofitable companies
- Less volatile than P/E ratio
- Easy to calculate
- Good for comparing companies

## Limitations
- Doesn't account for profitability
- May not reflect true value
- Industry-specific variations
- Revenue can be manipulated

## Industry Considerations
- **Technology**: Higher P/S due to growth potential
- **Banking**: Lower P/S due to leverage
- **Manufacturing**: Moderate P/S, asset-heavy
- **Utilities**: Lower P/S, regulated returns

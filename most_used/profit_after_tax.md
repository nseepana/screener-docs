Profit After Tax (PAT) represents the net profit earned by a company after deducting all expenses, interest, and taxes from total revenue. It's the final profit available to shareholders.

## Formula

PAT = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold - Operating Expenses - Interest - Tax
```

## Components

If a company has:
- Revenue: ₹1,000 Cr
- Cost of Goods Sold: ₹600 Cr
- Operating Expenses: ₹200 Cr
- Interest: ₹50 Cr

**PAT = ₹1,000 - ₹600 - ₹200 - ₹50 - ₹30 = ₹120 Cr**

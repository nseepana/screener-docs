# Profit Growth


Profit Growth measures the percentage increase in a company's net profit over a specific period. TTM (Trailing Twelve Months) profit growth compares the last 4 quarters with the preceding 4 quarters.

## Formula
```text
Profit Growth = ((Current TTM Profit - Previous TTM Profit) / Previous TTM Profit) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Net profit after tax, trailing 12 months data
- **Excluded**: Extraordinary items, one-time gains/losses
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Calculated quarterly

## Interpretation
| Growth Rate | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| > 25% | High growth, expansion phase |
| 15-25% | Good growth, stable expansion |
| 5-15% | Moderate growth, mature business |
| 0-5% | Slow growth, market saturation |
| Negative | Declining profits, challenges |

## Example
If a company has:
- Current TTM Profit: ₹120 Cr
- Previous TTM Profit: ₹100 Cr

**Profit Growth = ((₹120 - ₹100) / ₹100) × 100 = 20%**

## Advantages

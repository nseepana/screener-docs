# Promoter Holding [Prom. Hold.]


Promoter Holding represents the percentage of shares held by the company's promoters (founders, controlling shareholders) as per the latest shareholding filing. It indicates the level of promoter confidence and control.

## Formula
```text
Promoter Holding = (Promoter Shares / Total Outstanding Shares) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Shares held by promoters, their relatives, group companies
- **Excluded**: Public shares, institutional holdings, employee stock options
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated quarterly with shareholding filings

## Interpretation
| Promoter Holding | Interpretation |
|------------------|----------------|
| > 75% | High promoter control, potential delisting risk |
| 51-75% | Strong promoter control, stable management |
| 25-51% | Moderate promoter control, balanced ownership |
| < 25% | Low promoter control, potential takeover target |

## Example
If a company has:
- Promoter Shares: 5 Cr
- Total Outstanding Shares: 10 Cr

**Promoter Holding = (5 Cr / 10 Cr) × 100 = 50%**

## Advantages
- Indicates promoter confidence
- Shows management stability
- Useful for governance analysis
- Helps assess control structure

## Limitations
- Doesn't show promoter quality
- May not reflect business performance
- Can be misleading if promoters are different
- Doesn't consider voting rights

## Industry Considerations
- **Family-owned**: High promoter holding
- **Professional**: Lower promoter holding
- **Government**: Variable promoter holding
- **MNC Subsidiaries**: Low promoter holding

# Return on Assets


Return on Assets (ROA) measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit. It indicates the company's ability to generate earnings from its asset base.

## Formula
```text
ROA = (Net Profit / Average Total Assets) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Net profit after tax, average total assets
- **Excluded**: Extraordinary items, non-operating assets
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Calculated quarterly and annually

## Interpretation
| ROA Range | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| > 15% | Excellent asset utilization |
| 10-15% | Good asset utilization |
| 5-10% | Average asset utilization |
| 0-5% | Poor asset utilization |
| Negative | Loss-making, inefficient assets |

## Example
If a company has:
- Net Profit: ₹150 Cr
- Beginning Total Assets: ₹800 Cr
- Ending Total Assets: ₹1,200 Cr
- Average Total Assets: (₹800 + ₹1,200) / 2 = ₹1,000 Cr

**ROA = (₹150 Cr / ₹1,000 Cr) × 100 = 15%**

## Advantages
- Measures asset efficiency
- Indicates management effectiveness
- Useful for comparing companies
- Shows operational performance

## Limitations
- Doesn't account for debt levels
- May not reflect cash generation
- Industry-specific variations
- Can be manipulated through accounting

## Industry Considerations
- **Technology**: High ROA, asset-light
- **Banking**: Lower ROA, high leverage
- **Manufacturing**: Moderate ROA, capital intensive
- **Utilities**: Lower ROA, regulated returns

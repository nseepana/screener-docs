# Return on Capital Employed


Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) measures the efficiency of capital utilization by comparing earnings before interest and taxes to the total capital employed. It indicates how well a company generates profits from its capital.

## Formula
```text
ROCE = (EBIT / Average Capital Employed) × 100
Capital Employed = Share Capital + Reserves + Borrowings
```

## Components
- **Included**: EBIT, average capital employed (equity + debt)
- **Excluded**: Non-operating income, extraordinary items
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Calculated quarterly and annually

## Interpretation
| ROCE Range | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| > 20% | Excellent capital efficiency |
| 15-20% | Good capital efficiency |
| 10-15% | Average capital efficiency |
| 5-10% | Below average efficiency |
| < 5% | Poor capital efficiency |

## Example
If a company has:
- EBIT: ₹200 Cr
- Average Capital Employed: ₹1,000 Cr

**ROCE = (₹200 Cr / ₹1,000 Cr) × 100 = 20%**

## Advantages
- Measures capital efficiency
- Accounts for both equity and debt
- Useful for comparing companies
- Indicates management effectiveness

## Limitations
- Doesn't account for growth
- May not reflect cash generation
- Industry-specific variations
- Can be manipulated through accounting

## Industry Considerations
- **Technology**: High ROCE, asset-light
- **Banking**: Lower ROCE due to regulations
- **Manufacturing**: Moderate ROCE, capital intensive
- **Utilities**: Lower ROCE, regulated returns

# Return on Equity [ROE]


Return on Equity (ROE) measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. It indicates how efficiently management is using shareholders' equity to generate profits.

## Formula
```text
ROE = (Net Profit / Average Shareholders' Equity) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Net profit after tax, average shareholders' equity
- **Excluded**: Preferred dividends, extraordinary items
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Quarterly and annually calculated

## Interpretation
| ROE Range | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| > 20% | Excellent profitability |
| 15-20% | Good profitability |
| 10-15% | Average profitability |
| 5-10% | Below average |
| < 5% | Poor profitability |

## Example
If a company has:
- Net Profit: ₹50 Cr
- Beginning Equity: ₹200 Cr
- Ending Equity: ₹300 Cr
- Average Equity: (₹200 + ₹300) / 2 = ₹250 Cr

**ROE = (₹50 Cr / ₹250 Cr) × 100 = 20%**

## Advantages
- Measures management efficiency
- Indicates profit generation capability
- Useful for comparing companies
- Key metric for investors

## Limitations
- Can be manipulated through debt
- Doesn't account for risk
- Industry-specific variations
- May not reflect cash generation

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: Typically 10-15% due to high leverage
- **Technology**: Can be 20-30% with low capital needs
- **Manufacturing**: 15-25% depending on efficiency
- **Utilities**: Lower due to regulatory constraints

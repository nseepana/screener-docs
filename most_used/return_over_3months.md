# Return Over 3 Months


Return Over 3 Months measures the percentage change in stock price over the last 3 months. It indicates short-term price performance and market sentiment towards the stock.

## Formula
```text
3-Month Return = ((Current Price - Price 3 Months Ago) / Price 3 Months Ago) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current stock price, stock price from 3 months ago
- **Excluded**: Dividends, stock splits, bonus issues
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily with price changes

## Interpretation
| Return Range | Interpretation |
|--------------|----------------|
| > 20% | Strong positive momentum |
| 5-20% | Good performance |
| -5% to 5% | Neutral performance |
| -20% to -5% | Weak performance |
| < -20% | Poor performance, potential concerns |

## Example
If a stock shows:
- Current Price: ₹1,200
- Price 3 Months Ago: ₹1,000

**3-Month Return = ((₹1,200 - ₹1,000) / ₹1,000) × 100 = 20%**

## Advantages

# Return Over 5 Years [5Yrs return]


Return Over 5 Years measures the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of stock price over the last 5 years. It indicates long-term price performance and provides a stable view of stock appreciation over an extended period.

## Formula
```text
5-Year Return CAGR = ((Current Price / Price 5 Years Ago)^(1/5) - 1) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current stock price, stock price from 5 years ago
- **Excluded**: Dividends, stock splits, bonus issues
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily with price changes

## Interpretation
| CAGR Range | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| > 20% | Exceptional long-term performance |
| 15-20% | Strong long-term performance |
| 10-15% | Good long-term performance |
| 5-10% | Moderate long-term performance |
| 0-5% | Weak long-term performance |
| Negative | Poor long-term performance |

## Example
If a stock shows:
- Current Price: ₹2,000
- Price 5 Years Ago: ₹1,000

**5-Year Return CAGR = ((₹2,000 / ₹1,000)^(1/5) - 1) × 100 = 14.87%**

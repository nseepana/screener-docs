# Return Over 6 Months [6mth return]


Return Over 6 Months measures the percentage change in stock price over the last 6 months. It indicates medium-term price performance and provides a more stable view of stock performance compared to shorter timeframes.

## Formula
```text
6-Month Return = ((Current Price - Price 6 Months Ago) / Price 6 Months Ago) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current stock price, stock price from 6 months ago
- **Excluded**: Dividends, stock splits, bonus issues
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily with price changes

## Interpretation
| Return Range | Interpretation |
|--------------|----------------|
| > 30% | Exceptional performance, strong momentum |

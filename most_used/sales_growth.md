# Sales Growth


Sales Growth measures the percentage increase in a company's revenue over a specific period. TTM (Trailing Twelve Months) sales growth compares the last 4 quarters with the preceding 4 quarters.

## Formula
```text
Sales Growth = ((Current TTM Sales - Previous TTM Sales) / Previous TTM Sales) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Revenue from core operations, trailing 12 months data
- **Excluded**: Extraordinary items, one-time revenue
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Calculated quarterly

## Interpretation
| Growth Rate | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| > 20% | High growth, expansion phase |
| 10-20% | Good growth, stable expansion |
| 5-10% | Moderate growth, mature business |
| 0-5% | Slow growth, market saturation |
| Negative | Declining sales, challenges |

## Example
If a company has:
- Current TTM Sales: ₹1,200 Cr
- Previous TTM Sales: ₹1,000 Cr

**Sales Growth = ((₹1,200 - ₹1,000) / ₹1,000) × 100 = 20%**

## Advantages
- Indicates business momentum
- Shows market expansion

## Limitations

# YOY Quarterly Profit Growth


Year-on-Year (YOY) Quarterly Profit Growth measures the percentage change in quarterly profit after tax compared to the same quarter in the previous year. It eliminates seasonal variations and shows the underlying profitability growth trend.

## Formula
```text
YOY Quarterly Profit Growth = ((Current Quarter PAT - Same Quarter Previous Year PAT) / Same Quarter Previous Year PAT) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current quarter PAT, same quarter previous year PAT
- **Excluded**: Extraordinary items, one-time gains/losses, non-operating income
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Calculated quarterly

## Interpretation
| Growth Rate | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| > 25% | High growth, strong profitability momentum |
| 15-25% | Good growth, healthy profit expansion |
| 5-15% | Moderate growth, stable profitability |
| 0-5% | Slow growth, margin pressure |
| Negative | Declining profits, business challenges |

## Example
If a company reports:
- Current Q4 PAT: ₹40 Cr
- Previous Q4 PAT: ₹30 Cr

**YOY Quarterly Profit Growth = ((₹40 - ₹30) / ₹30) × 100 = 33.33%**

## Advantages
- Eliminates seasonal variations
- Shows underlying profitability growth

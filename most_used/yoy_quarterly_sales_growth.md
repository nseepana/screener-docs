# YOY Quarterly Sales Growth


Year-on-Year (YOY) Quarterly Sales Growth measures the percentage change in quarterly sales compared to the same quarter in the previous year. It eliminates seasonal variations and shows the underlying business growth trend.

## Formula
```text
YOY Quarterly Sales Growth = ((Current Quarter Sales - Same Quarter Previous Year Sales) / Same Quarter Previous Year Sales) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current quarter sales, same quarter previous year sales
- **Excluded**: Extraordinary items, one-time revenue, non-operating income
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Calculated quarterly

## Interpretation
| Growth Rate | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| > 20% | High growth, strong business momentum |
| 10-20% | Good growth, healthy expansion |
| 5-10% | Moderate growth, stable business |
| 0-5% | Slow growth, market saturation |
| Negative | Declining sales, business challenges |

## Example
If a company reports:
- Current Q4 Sales: ₹300 Cr
- Previous Q4 Sales: ₹250 Cr

**YOY Quarterly Sales Growth = ((₹300 - ₹250) / ₹250) × 100 = 20%**

## Advantages
- Eliminates seasonal variations
- Shows underlying business growth
- Useful for trend analysis

- Can be affected by one-time events
- Doesn't account for profitability

## Industry Considerations

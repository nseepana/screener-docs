# DMA 200 [200 DMA]

The 200-day moving average is a long-term trend indicator that smooths out price fluctuations to show the overall direction of a stock's price movement over approximately 8-9 months of trading.

## Formula
```text
200 DMA = (Sum of closing prices for last 200 days) / 200
```

## Components
- **Included**: Closing prices from the last 200 trading days
- **Excluded**: Intraday prices, volume data, fundamental metrics
- **Unit**: Rs. (Indian Rupees)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily with each new closing price

## Interpretation
| Price vs 200 DMA | Interpretation |
|------------------|----------------|
| Above 200 DMA | Bullish trend, potential support level |
| Below 200 DMA | Bearish trend, potential resistance level |
| Price crossing above | Bullish signal, trend reversal possible |
| Price crossing below | Bearish signal, trend reversal possible |
| Price near 200 DMA | Key support/resistance level |

## Example
If a stock's 200-day moving average is ₹1,500:
- Current Price: ₹1,600 (Above 200 DMA - Bullish)
- Current Price: ₹1,400 (Below 200 DMA - Bearish)
- Price crosses from ₹1,480 to ₹1,520 (Bullish crossover)

## Advantages
- Smooths out short-term volatility
- Identifies long-term trends
- Acts as dynamic support/resistance
- Widely followed by institutional investors

## Industry Considerations

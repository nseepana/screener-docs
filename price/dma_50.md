# DMA 50 [50 DMA]

The 50-day moving average is a medium-term trend indicator that smooths out price fluctuations to show the overall direction of a stock's price movement over approximately 2-3 months of trading.

## Formula
```text
50 DMA = (Sum of closing prices for last 50 days) / 50
```

## Components
- **Included**: Closing prices from the last 50 trading days
- **Excluded**: Intraday prices, volume data, fundamental metrics
- **Unit**: Rs. (Indian Rupees)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily with each new closing price

## Interpretation
| Price vs 50 DMA | Interpretation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Above 50 DMA | Bullish trend, potential support level |
| Below 50 DMA | Bearish trend, potential resistance level |
| Price crossing above | Bullish signal, trend reversal possible |
| Price crossing below | Bearish signal, trend reversal possible |
| Price near 50 DMA | Key support/resistance level |

## Example
If a stock's 50-day moving average is ₹1,200:
- Current Price: ₹1,300 (Above 50 DMA - Bullish)
- Current Price: ₹1,100 (Below 50 DMA - Bearish)
- Price crosses from ₹1,180 to ₹1,220 (Bullish crossover)

## Advantages

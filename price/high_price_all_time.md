The all-time high price represents the highest price at which a stock has ever traded since 2005, serving as the ultimate resistance level and historical reference point for investors.

## Formula
```text
All Time High = Maximum(High prices since 2005)
```

## Components
- **Included**: Highest trading price since 2005
- **Excluded**: Prices before 2005, current day's high
- **Unit**: Rs. (Indian Rupees)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily if new all-time high is reached

## Interpretation
| Price vs All Time High | Interpretation |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Near All Time High | Ultimate resistance level, potential breakout |
| At All Time High | New all-time high, exceptional momentum |
| Far from All Time High | Weak performance, bearish trend |
| Breaking All Time High | Historic breakout, potential major uptrend |
| Rejecting from All Time High | Bearish reversal, resistance holding |

## Example
If a stock's all-time high is ₹5,000:
- Current Price: ₹4,950 (Near resistance - Watch for breakout)

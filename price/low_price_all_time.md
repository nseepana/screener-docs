# Low price all time [All time low]

The all-time low price represents the lowest price at which a stock has ever traded since 2005, serving as the ultimate support level and historical reference point for investors.

## Formula
```text
All Time Low = Minimum(Low prices since 2005)
```

## Components
- **Included**: Lowest trading price since 2005
- **Excluded**: Prices before 2005, current day's low
- **Unit**: Rs. (Indian Rupees)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily if new all-time low is reached

## Interpretation
| Price vs All Time Low | Interpretation |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| Near All Time Low | Ultimate support level, potential bounce |
| At All Time Low | New all-time low, exceptional weakness |
| Far from All Time Low | Strong performance, bullish trend |
| Breaking All Time Low | Historic breakdown, potential major downtrend |
| Bouncing from All Time Low | Bullish reversal, support holding |

## Example
If a stock's all-time low is ₹100:
- Current Price: ₹105 (Near support - Watch for bounce)

- Current Price: ₹500 (Far from low - Strong performance)

## Advantages

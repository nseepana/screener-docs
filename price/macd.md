# MACD [MACD]

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a momentum oscillator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a stock's price, helping identify trend changes and momentum shifts.

## Formula
```text
MACD = 12-day EMA - 26-day EMA
Signal Line = 9-day EMA of MACD
Histogram = MACD - Signal Line
```

## Components
- **Included**: 12-day and 26-day exponential moving averages
- **Excluded**: Volume data, fundamental metrics
- **Unit**: Price units (Rs.)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily with each new closing price

## Interpretation
| MACD Value | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| MACD > 0 | Bullish momentum, uptrend |
| MACD < 0 | Bearish momentum, downtrend |
| MACD > Signal | Bullish crossover, buy signal |
| MACD < Signal | Bearish crossover, sell signal |
| MACD rising | Increasing bullish momentum |
| MACD falling | Increasing bearish momentum |

## Example
If MACD = 5.2 and Signal = 3.8:
- MACD > Signal (Bullish crossover)
- MACD > 0 (Bullish momentum)
- Histogram = 1.4 (Positive momentum)

## Advantages
- Identifies trend changes early
- Shows momentum direction
- Works well in trending markets
- Combines trend and momentum analysis
- Widely used by technical analysts

## Limitations
- Lagging indicator
- Gives false signals in sideways markets
- Requires confirmation from other indicators
- Can be whipsawed in volatile markets
- Less effective in ranging markets

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: Sensitive to interest rate changes
- **Technology**: More responsive to growth cycles
- **FMCG**: Generally more stable signals
- **Commodities**: Can be affected by seasonal patterns

## Key Terms
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: A momentum oscillator that shows the relationship between two moving averages.
- **Signal Line**: A 9-day exponential moving average of the MACD line, used to generate trading signals.
- **Histogram**: The difference between MACD and its signal line, showing momentum changes.
- **Bullish Crossover**: When MACD crosses above the signal line, indicating potential upward momentum.
- **Bearish Crossover**: When MACD crosses below the signal line, indicating potential downward momentum.
- **Divergence**: When MACD moves in the opposite direction of price, often signaling a potential reversal.
- **Momentum Oscillator**: A technical indicator that measures the rate of change in price movement.
- **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: A type of moving average that gives more weight to recent prices.
- **Zero Line**: The horizontal line at zero on the MACD chart, separating bullish and bearish territory.
- **Whipsaw**: Rapid back-and-forth movements that can cause false signals in technical indicators.

# Return over 1day [1day return]

The 1-day return measures the percentage change in a stock's price from the previous trading day's closing price to the current day's closing price, indicating short-term price movement.

## Formula
```text
1-day Return = ((Current Price - Previous Day's Close) / Previous Day's Close) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current day's closing price and previous day's closing price
- **Excluded**: Intraday prices, dividends, stock splits
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily after market close

## Interpretation
| Return Range | Interpretation |
|--------------|----------------|
| > +5% | Strong positive momentum, potential breakout |
| +2% to +5% | Moderate positive movement |
| -2% to +2% | Normal trading range |
| -5% to -2% | Moderate negative movement |
| < -5% | Strong negative momentum, potential breakdown |

## Example
If a stock's previous close was ₹1,000 and current price is ₹1,050:
- 1-day Return = ((1,050 - 1,000) / 1,000) × 100 = +5%
- This indicates strong positive momentum

# Return over 1month [1mth return]

The 1-month return measures the percentage change in a stock's price over the last 30 calendar days, providing insight into medium-term price momentum and trend sustainability.

## Formula
```text
1-month Return = ((Current Price - Price 30 days ago) / Price 30 days ago) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current price and price from 30 calendar days ago
- **Excluded**: Intraday prices, dividends, stock splits
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily after market close

## Interpretation
| Return Range | Interpretation |
|--------------|----------------|
| > +20% | Strong positive momentum, potential major uptrend |
| +5% to +20% | Moderate positive movement |
| -5% to +5% | Normal trading range |
| -20% to -5% | Moderate negative movement |
| < -20% | Strong negative momentum, potential major downtrend |

## Example
If a stock's price 30 days ago was ₹1,000 and current price is ₹1,150:
- 1-month Return = ((1,150 - 1,000) / 1,000) × 100 = +15%
- This indicates moderate positive momentum

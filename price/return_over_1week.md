# Return over 1week [1wk return]

The 1-week return measures the percentage change in a stock's price over the last 7 calendar days, providing insight into short-term price momentum and trend direction.

## Formula
```text
1-week Return = ((Current Price - Price 7 days ago) / Price 7 days ago) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current price and price from 7 calendar days ago
- **Excluded**: Intraday prices, dividends, stock splits
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily after market close

## Interpretation
| Return Range | Interpretation |
|--------------|----------------|
| > +10% | Strong positive momentum, potential uptrend |
| +3% to +10% | Moderate positive movement |
| -3% to +3% | Normal trading range |
| -10% to -3% | Moderate negative movement |
| < -10% | Strong negative momentum, potential downtrend |

## Example
If a stock's price 7 days ago was ₹1,000 and current price is ₹1,080:
- 1-week Return = ((1,080 - 1,000) / 1,000) × 100 = +8%
- This indicates moderate positive momentum

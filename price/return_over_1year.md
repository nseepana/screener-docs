# Return over 1year [1Yr return]

The 1-year return measures the percentage change in a stock's price over the last 12 months, providing insight into annual performance and long-term trend direction.

## Formula
```text
1-year Return = ((Current Price - Price 12 months ago) / Price 12 months ago) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current price and price from 12 months ago
- **Excluded**: Intraday prices, dividends, stock splits
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily after market close

## Interpretation
| Return Range | Interpretation |
|--------------|----------------|
| > +50% | Exceptional performance, strong uptrend |
| +20% to +50% | Strong positive performance |
| -10% to +20% | Normal to good performance |
| -30% to -10% | Poor performance |
| < -30% | Exceptional underperformance, strong downtrend |

## Example
If a stock's price 12 months ago was ₹1,000 and current price is ₹1,300:
- 1-year Return = ((1,300 - 1,000) / 1,000) × 100 = +30%
- This indicates strong annual performance

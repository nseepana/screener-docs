# Return over 3months [3mth return]

The 3-month return measures the percentage change in a stock's price over the last 90 calendar days, providing insight into quarterly performance and medium-term trend direction.

## Formula
```text
3-month Return = ((Current Price - Price 90 days ago) / Price 90 days ago) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current price and price from 90 calendar days ago
- **Excluded**: Intraday prices, dividends, stock splits
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily after market close

## Interpretation
| Return Range | Interpretation |
|--------------|----------------|
| > +30% | Exceptional quarterly performance, strong uptrend |
| +10% to +30% | Strong positive performance |
| -5% to +10% | Normal to good performance |
| -20% to -5% | Poor performance |
| < -20% | Exceptional underperformance, strong downtrend |

## Example
If a stock's price 90 days ago was ₹1,000 and current price is ₹1,200:
- 3-month Return = ((1,200 - 1,000) / 1,000) × 100 = +20%
- This indicates strong quarterly performance

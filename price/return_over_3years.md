# Return over 3years [3Yrs return]

The 3-year return measures the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of a stock's price over the last 3 years, providing insight into sustained long-term performance and trend consistency.

## Formula
```text
3-year CAGR = ((Current Price / Price 3 years ago)^(1/3) - 1) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current price and price from 3 years ago
- **Excluded**: Intraday prices, dividends, stock splits
- **Unit**: Percentage per annum (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily after market close

## Interpretation
| CAGR Range | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| > +25% | Exceptional growth, strong compound returns |
| +15% to +25% | Strong growth performance |
| +5% to +15% | Good growth performance |
| -5% to +5% | Moderate to flat performance |
| < -5% | Poor performance, declining trend |

## Example
If a stock's price 3 years ago was ₹1,000 and current price is ₹1,728:
- 3-year CAGR = ((1,728 / 1,000)^(1/3) - 1) × 100 = +20%
- This indicates strong compound annual growth

## Advantages
- Shows sustained long-term performance
- Accounts for compounding effect
- Useful for long-term investment evaluation
- Less affected by short-term volatility
- Good for comparing different investments

## Limitations
- May not reflect recent performance
- Can be skewed by extreme price movements
- Doesn't account for dividends
- Single 3-year period may not show full cycle
- May not reflect current fundamentals

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: Sensitive to economic cycles over 3 years
- **Technology**: High growth potential but volatile
- **FMCG**: Generally more stable, consistent growth
- **Commodities**: Highly cyclical over 3-year periods

# Return over 5years [5Yrs return]

The 5-year return measures the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of a stock's price over the last 5 years, providing insight into sustained long-term performance and trend consistency across multiple market cycles.

## Formula
```text
5-year CAGR = ((Current Price / Price 5 years ago)^(1/5) - 1) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current price and price from 5 years ago
- **Excluded**: Intraday prices, dividends, stock splits
- **Unit**: Percentage per annum (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily after market close

## Interpretation
| CAGR Range | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| > +20% | Exceptional long-term growth |
| +12% to +20% | Strong long-term performance |
| +6% to +12% | Good long-term performance |
| 0% to +6% | Moderate long-term performance |
| < 0% | Poor long-term performance |

## Example
If a stock's price 5 years ago was ₹1,000 and current price is ₹2,488:
- 5-year CAGR = ((2,488 / 1,000)^(1/5) - 1) × 100 = +20%
- This indicates exceptional long-term growth

## Advantages
- Shows sustained performance across cycles
- Accounts for compounding effect
- Useful for long-term investment evaluation
- Less affected by short-term volatility
- Good for comparing different investments

## Limitations
- May not reflect recent performance
- Can be skewed by extreme price movements
- Doesn't account for dividends
- Single 5-year period may not show full cycle
- May not reflect current fundamentals

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: Sensitive to complete economic cycles
- **Technology**: High growth potential but volatile
- **FMCG**: Generally more stable, consistent growth
- **Commodities**: Highly cyclical over 5-year periods

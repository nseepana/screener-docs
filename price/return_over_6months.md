# Return over 6months [6mth return]

The 6-month return measures the percentage change in a stock's price over the last 180 calendar days, providing insight into semi-annual performance and medium-term trend direction.

## Formula
```text
6-month Return = ((Current Price - Price 180 days ago) / Price 180 days ago) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current price and price from 180 calendar days ago
- **Excluded**: Intraday prices, dividends, stock splits
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily after market close

## Interpretation
| Return Range | Interpretation |
|--------------|----------------|
| > +40% | Exceptional semi-annual performance, strong uptrend |
| +15% to +40% | Strong positive performance |
| -10% to +15% | Normal to good performance |
| -30% to -10% | Poor performance |
| < -30% | Exceptional underperformance, strong downtrend |

## Example
If a stock's price 180 days ago was ₹1,000 and current price is ₹1,300:
- 6-month Return = ((1,300 - 1,000) / 1,000) × 100 = +30%
- This indicates strong semi-annual performance

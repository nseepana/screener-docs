# Return over 7years [7Yrs return]

The 7-year return measures the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of a stock's price over the last 7 years, providing insight into sustained long-term performance and trend consistency across multiple market cycles.

## Formula
```text
7-year CAGR = ((Current Price / Price 7 years ago)^(1/7) - 1) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current price and price from 7 years ago
- **Excluded**: Intraday prices, dividends, stock splits
- **Unit**: Percentage per annum (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily after market close

## Interpretation
| CAGR Range | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| > +20% | Exceptional long-term growth |
| +12% to +20% | Strong long-term performance |
| +6% to +12% | Good long-term performance |
| 0% to +6% | Moderate long-term performance |
| < 0% | Poor long-term performance |

## Example
If a stock's price 7 years ago was ₹1,000 and current price is ₹3,583:
- 7-year CAGR = ((3,583 / 1,000)^(1/7) - 1) × 100 = +20%
- This indicates exceptional long-term growth

## Advantages
- Shows sustained performance across cycles
- Accounts for compounding effect
- Useful for long-term investment evaluation
- Less affected by short-term volatility
- Good for comparing different investments

## Limitations
- May not reflect recent performance
- Can be skewed by extreme price movements
- Doesn't account for dividends
- Single 7-year period may not show full cycle
- May not reflect current fundamentals

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: Sensitive to complete economic cycles
- **Technology**: High growth potential but volatile
- **FMCG**: Generally more stable, consistent growth
- **Commodities**: Highly cyclical over 7-year periods

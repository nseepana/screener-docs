# RSI [RSI]

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and magnitude of price changes, helping identify overbought and oversold conditions in a stock.

## Formula
```text
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
RS = Average Gain / Average Loss (over 14 periods)
```

## Components
- **Included**: 14-day average gains and losses
- **Excluded**: Volume data, fundamental metrics
- **Unit**: Percentage (0-100)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily with each new closing price

## Interpretation
| RSI Value | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| RSI > 70 | Overbought condition, potential sell signal |
| RSI < 30 | Oversold condition, potential buy signal |
| RSI 50-70 | Bullish momentum, uptrend |
| RSI 30-50 | Bearish momentum, downtrend |
| RSI = 50 | Neutral, no clear momentum |

## Example
If RSI = 75:
- Overbought condition (Above 70)
- Potential for price correction
- Consider selling or waiting for pullback

## Advantages
- Identifies overbought/oversold conditions
- Works well in ranging markets
- Easy to interpret (0-100 scale)
- Widely used by technical analysts
- Good for contrarian strategies

## Limitations
- Can stay overbought/oversold for extended periods
- Less effective in strong trending markets
- Gives false signals in volatile stocks
- Requires confirmation from other indicators
- May miss early trend changes

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: Generally more stable RSI patterns
- **Technology**: Often reaches extreme levels during growth phases
- **FMCG**: More reliable RSI signals due to stability
- **Commodities**: Can be affected by seasonal patterns

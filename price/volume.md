# Volume [Vol 1d]

The daily trading volume represents the total number of shares traded on the last trading day across all exchanges, indicating the level of market interest and liquidity in a stock.

## Formula
```text
Volume = Sum of all shares traded across all exchanges on the trading day
```

## Components
- **Included**: All share transactions on the trading day
- **Excluded**: Off-market transactions, block deals
- **Unit**: Number of shares
- **Frequency**: Updated daily after market close

## Interpretation
| Volume Level | Interpretation |
|--------------|----------------|
| High Volume | Strong interest, potential trend confirmation |
| Low Volume | Weak interest, potential trend weakness |
| Above Average | Increased activity, watch for breakouts |
| Below Average | Decreased activity, consolidation phase |
| Unusual Spike | News-driven activity, high volatility |

## Example
If a stock's average volume is 1M shares:
- Today's Volume: 2.5M (High - Strong interest)
- Today's Volume: 500K (Low - Weak interest)
- Today's Volume: 1.2M (Above average - Moderate activity)

## Advantages
- Confirms price movements
- Indicates market interest level
- Helps identify breakouts and reversals
- Measures liquidity
- Useful for risk assessment

## Limitations
- Can be manipulated by large trades
- Doesn't predict price direction
- Varies significantly by stock size
- May not reflect fundamental value
- Can be misleading in low-float stocks

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: Generally higher volumes due to institutional interest
- **Technology**: High volatility in volumes during earnings
- **FMCG**: More stable, consistent volumes
- **Small-cap**: Lower absolute volumes but higher relative activity

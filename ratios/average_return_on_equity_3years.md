# Average Return on Equity 3Years [ROE 3Yr]

The 3-year average ROE provides a smoothed view of a company's profitability over time, helping to identify sustained performance trends and reduce the impact of one-time events.

## Formula
```text
ROE 3Yr = (ROE Year 1 + ROE Year 2 + ROE Year 3) / 3
```

## Components
- **Included**: ROE values from the last 3 years
- **Excluded**: Extraordinary items, one-time gains/losses
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated quarterly with financial results

## Interpretation
| 3Yr ROE Range | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------------|
| > 20% | Excellent sustained profitability |
| 15% - 20% | Good sustained profitability |
| 10% - 15% | Average sustained profitability |
| 5% - 10% | Below average, needs improvement |
| < 5% | Poor sustained profitability |

## Example
If a company's ROE over 3 years is:
- Year 1: 18%
- Year 2: 22%
- Year 3: 20%
- 3Yr Average ROE = (18 + 22 + 20) / 3 = 20%

## Advantages
- Shows sustained profitability
- Reduces impact of one-time events
- Good for trend analysis
- Useful for long-term assessment
- Less volatile than single-year ROE

## Limitations

# Days Inventory Outstanding [Inventory Days]

The Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) measures the average number of days a company holds inventory before selling it, indicating the efficiency of inventory management and production processes.

## Formula
```text
DIO = (Average Inventory / Cost of Goods Sold) × 365
```

## Components
- **Included**: Average inventory, cost of goods sold
- **Excluded**: Work in progress, finished goods not yet sold
- **Unit**: Days
- **Frequency**: Updated quarterly with financial results

## Interpretation
| DIO Range | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| < 30 days | Excellent inventory management |
| 30 - 60 days | Good inventory management |
| 60 - 90 days | Average inventory management |
| 90 - 120 days | Poor inventory management |
| > 120 days | Very poor inventory management |

## Example
If a company has:
- Average Inventory: ₹200 crores
- Cost of Goods Sold: ₹1,200 crores
- DIO = (200 / 1,200) × 365 = 60.8 days

## Advantages
- Measures inventory efficiency
- Easy to calculate and understand
- Good for comparing companies
- Shows operational effectiveness
- Useful for cash flow analysis

## Limitations

## Industry Considerations
- **Retail**: Generally lower due to fast-moving goods
- **Technology**: Often lower due to rapid obsolescence
- **Manufacturing**: Varies by production cycle
- **Automotive**: Generally higher due to complex products

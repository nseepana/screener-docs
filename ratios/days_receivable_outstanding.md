# Days Receivable Outstanding [Days Receivable]

The Days Receivable Outstanding (DSO) measures the average number of days it takes a company to collect payment from its customers after a sale, indicating the efficiency of credit and collection policies.

## Formula
```text
DSO = (Accounts Receivable / Annual Sales) × 365
```

## Components
- **Included**: Accounts receivable, annual sales revenue
- **Excluded**: Cash sales, advance payments
- **Unit**: Days
- **Frequency**: Updated quarterly with financial results

## Interpretation
| DSO Range | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| < 30 days | Excellent collection efficiency |
| 30 - 45 days | Good collection efficiency |
| 45 - 60 days | Average collection efficiency |
| 60 - 90 days | Poor collection efficiency |
| > 90 days | Very poor collection efficiency |

## Example
If a company has:
- Accounts Receivable: ₹100 crores
- Annual Sales: ₹1,200 crores
- DSO = (100 / 1,200) × 365 = 30.4 days

## Advantages
- Measures collection efficiency
- Easy to calculate and understand
- Good for comparing companies
- Shows credit policy effectiveness
- Useful for cash flow analysis

## Limitations

## Industry Considerations
- **Retail**: Generally lower due to cash sales
- **Manufacturing**: Often higher due to credit terms
- **Technology**: Varies by business model
- **Services**: Generally higher due to billing cycles

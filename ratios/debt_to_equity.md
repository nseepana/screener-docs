# Debt to Equity [Debt / Eq]

The Debt-to-Equity ratio measures the relative proportion of debt and equity used to finance a company's assets, indicating the company's financial leverage and risk profile.

## Formula
```text
Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Shareholders' Equity
```

## Components
- **Included**: Total debt (short-term + long-term), total shareholders' equity
- **Excluded**: Operating leases, contingent liabilities
- **Unit**: Multiple (times)
- **Frequency**: Updated quarterly with financial results

## Interpretation
| D/E Ratio | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| < 0.5 | Low leverage, conservative financing |
| 0.5 - 1.0 | Moderate leverage, balanced approach |
| 1.0 - 2.0 | High leverage, aggressive financing |
| 2.0 - 3.0 | Very high leverage, high risk |
| > 3.0 | Extremely high leverage, very high risk |

## Example
If a company has:
- Total Debt: ₹200 crores
- Total Equity: ₹300 crores
- D/E Ratio = 200 / 300 = 0.67

## Advantages

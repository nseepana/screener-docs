# Dividend Yield [Div Yld]

The Dividend Yield measures the annual dividend payment as a percentage of the current stock price, indicating the return on investment from dividends alone.

## Formula
```text
Dividend Yield = (Annual Dividend per Share / Current Market Price) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Annual dividend per share, current market price
- **Excluded**: Special dividends, stock dividends
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily with market price changes

## Interpretation
| Dividend Yield | Interpretation |
|----------------|----------------|
| > 5% | High yield, income-focused investment |
| 3% - 5% | Good yield, balanced income and growth |
| 1% - 3% | Moderate yield, growth-focused |
| 0.5% - 1% | Low yield, primarily growth investment |
| < 0.5% | Very low yield, pure growth play |

## Example
If a stock has:
- Annual Dividend: ₹20 per share
- Current Price: ₹500
- Dividend Yield = (20 / 500) × 100 = 4%

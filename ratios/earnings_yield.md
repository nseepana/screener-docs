# Earnings Yield [Earnings Yield]

The Earnings Yield measures the return on investment from a company's earnings relative to its enterprise value, providing an alternative perspective to the P/E ratio for valuation analysis.

## Formula
```text
Earnings Yield = (Trailing EBIT / Enterprise Value) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Trailing 12-month EBIT, enterprise value
- **Excluded**: Extraordinary items, one-time gains/losses
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated quarterly with financial results

## Interpretation
| Earnings Yield | Interpretation |
|----------------|----------------|
| > 10% | High yield, potentially undervalued |
| 6% - 10% | Good yield, reasonable valuation |
| 3% - 6% | Moderate yield, fair valuation |
| 1% - 3% | Low yield, expensive valuation |
| < 1% | Very low yield, very expensive |

## Example
If a company has:
- Trailing EBIT: ₹100 crores
- Enterprise Value: ₹1,500 crores
- Earnings Yield = (100 / 1,500) × 100 = 6.67%

## Advantages

# Enterprise Value [EV]

The Enterprise Value (EV) represents the total value of a company, including both equity and debt, minus cash and cash equivalents, providing a more comprehensive valuation metric than market capitalization alone.

## Formula
```text
Enterprise Value = Market Capitalization + Total Debt - Cash and Cash Equivalents
```

## Components
- **Included**: Market cap, total debt, cash and cash equivalents
- **Excluded**: Minority interests, preferred stock
- **Unit**: Rs. Crores
- **Frequency**: Updated daily with market data

## Interpretation
| EV Range | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| < Market Cap | Company has more cash than debt |
| = Market Cap | Company has balanced cash and debt |
| > Market Cap | Company has more debt than cash |
| Very High EV | High leverage, potential risk |
| Very Low EV | Low leverage, potential opportunity |

## Example
If a company has:
- Market Cap: ₹1,000 crores
- Total Debt: ₹300 crores
- Cash: ₹100 crores
- EV = 1,000 + 300 - 100 = ₹1,200 crores

## Advantages
- More comprehensive than market cap
- Accounts for debt and cash
- Good for comparing companies
- Shows true company value
- Useful for acquisition analysis

## Limitations
- Can be complex to calculate
- May not reflect market sentiment
- Doesn't account for growth prospects
- Can be affected by accounting methods
- Doesn't consider intangible assets

## Industry Considerations
- **Technology**: Often lower due to high cash reserves
- **Banking**: Generally higher due to high debt
- **Manufacturing**: Varies by capital structure
- **Infrastructure**: Often higher due to project debt

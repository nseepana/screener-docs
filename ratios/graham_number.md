# Graham Number [Graham's Number]

The Graham Number is a conservative valuation method developed by Benjamin Graham to determine the maximum price an investor should pay for a stock, based on earnings and book value.

## Formula
```text
Graham Number = √(22.5 × EPS × Book Value per Share)
```

## Components
- **Included**: Earnings per share, book value per share
- **Excluded**: Growth prospects, market conditions
- **Unit**: Rs. (Indian Rupees)
- **Frequency**: Updated quarterly with financial results

## Interpretation
| Price vs Graham Number | Interpretation |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Price < 0.8 × Graham Number | Significantly undervalued |
| 0.8 - 1.0 × Graham Number | Undervalued to fairly valued |
| 1.0 - 1.2 × Graham Number | Fairly valued to slightly expensive |
| 1.2 - 1.5 × Graham Number | Expensive |
| Price > 1.5 × Graham Number | Significantly expensive |

## Example
If a stock has:
- EPS: ₹20
- Book Value per Share: ₹100
- Graham Number = √(22.5 × 20 × 100) = √45,000 = ₹212

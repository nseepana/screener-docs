# Historical PE 3Years [3Yrs PE]

The 3-year historical PE ratio provides a median valuation perspective over time, helping to identify whether a stock is currently trading above or below its historical valuation range.

## Formula
```text
3Yrs PE = Median(PE ratios over last 3 years)
```

## Components
- **Included**: PE ratios from the last 3 years
- **Excluded**: Extraordinary items, one-time gains/losses
- **Unit**: Multiple (times)
- **Frequency**: Updated quarterly with financial results

## Interpretation
| Current vs 3Yr PE | Interpretation |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Current < 0.8 × 3Yr PE | Significantly undervalued |
| 0.8 - 1.0 × 3Yr PE | Undervalued to fairly valued |
| 1.0 - 1.2 × 3Yr PE | Fairly valued to slightly expensive |
| 1.2 - 1.5 × 3Yr PE | Expensive |
| Current > 1.5 × 3Yr PE | Significantly expensive |

## Example
If a stock's PE ratios over 3 years are:
- Year 1: 18x, Year 2: 22x, Year 3: 20x
- 3Yr Median PE = 20x
- Current PE = 25x (25% above historical median)

## Advantages

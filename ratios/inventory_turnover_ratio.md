# Inventory Turnover Ratio [Inv TO]

The Inventory Turnover Ratio measures how efficiently a company manages its inventory by calculating how many times inventory is sold and replaced during a given period.

## Formula
```text
Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory
```

## Components
- **Included**: Cost of goods sold, average inventory
- **Excluded**: Work in progress, finished goods not yet sold
- **Unit**: Multiple (times)
- **Frequency**: Updated quarterly with financial results

## Interpretation
| Inventory Turnover | Interpretation |
|-------------------|----------------|
| > 10 | Excellent inventory management, high efficiency |
| 6 - 10 | Good inventory management, above average |
| 3 - 6 | Average inventory management, acceptable |
| 1 - 3 | Poor inventory management, needs improvement |
| < 1 | Very poor inventory management, high risk |

## Example
If a company has:
- Cost of Goods Sold: ₹1,000 crores
- Average Inventory: ₹200 crores
- Inventory Turnover = 1,000 / 200 = 5 times

## Advantages
- Measures inventory efficiency
- Easy to calculate and understand
- Good for comparing companies
- Shows operational effectiveness

## Limitations

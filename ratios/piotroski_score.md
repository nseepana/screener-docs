# Piotroski Score [Piotroski Scr]

The Piotroski Score is a comprehensive financial strength indicator that evaluates a company's financial health across nine criteria in three key areas: profitability, leverage, and operating efficiency.

## Formula
```text
Piotroski Score = Sum of 9 binary criteria (0 or 1 each)
Criteria: 4 Profitability + 3 Leverage + 2 Operating Efficiency
```

## Components
- **Included**: 9 financial criteria across profitability, leverage, and efficiency
- **Excluded**: Market-based metrics, qualitative factors
- **Unit**: Score (0-9)
- **Frequency**: Updated quarterly with financial results

## Interpretation
| Piotroski Score | Interpretation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| 8-9 | Excellent financial strength, high quality |
| 6-7 | Good financial strength, above average |
| 4-5 | Average financial strength, acceptable |
| 2-3 | Poor financial strength, below average |
| 0-1 | Very poor financial strength, high risk |

## Example
If a company scores:
- Profitability: 3/4 (positive ROA, positive ROE, positive CFO, positive accruals)
- Leverage: 2/3 (decreasing leverage, increasing current ratio, no new equity)
- Efficiency: 2/2 (increasing gross margin, increasing asset turnover)
- Total Score = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7

## Advantages
- Comprehensive financial assessment
- Easy to understand and compare
- Good for screening stocks
- Based on fundamental metrics
- Useful for value investing

## Limitations

# Price to Book Value [CMP / BV]

The Price-to-Book Value (P/BV) ratio compares a company's market price per share to its book value per share, indicating how much investors are willing to pay for each rupee of net assets.

## Formula
```text
P/BV Ratio = Current Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current market price, book value per share
- **Excluded**: Intangible assets, goodwill
- **Unit**: Multiple (times)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily with market price changes

## Interpretation
| P/BV Range | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| < 1.0 | Trading below book value, potential value |
| 1.0 - 2.0 | Fairly valued, reasonable premium |
| 2.0 - 3.0 | Moderately expensive, growth expectations |
| 3.0 - 5.0 | Expensive, high growth expectations |
| > 5.0 | Very expensive, speculative pricing |

## Example
If a stock has:
- Current Price: ₹500
- Book Value per Share: ₹200
- P/BV Ratio = 500 / 200 = 2.5x

## Advantages
- Easy to calculate and understand
- Good for value investing
- Less affected by accounting policies
- Useful for asset-heavy companies
- Good for comparing companies

## Limitations
- Doesn't account for growth prospects
- May not reflect true asset values
- Can be misleading for service companies
- Doesn't consider intangible assets
- May not reflect market conditions

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: Generally lower due to regulatory requirements
- **Technology**: Often higher due to intangible assets
- **Manufacturing**: Varies by asset intensity
- **Real Estate**: Generally closer to book value

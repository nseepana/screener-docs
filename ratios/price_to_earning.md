# Price to Earning [P/E]

The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio compares a company's current market price per share to its earnings per share, indicating how much investors are willing to pay for each rupee of earnings.

## Formula
```text
P/E Ratio = Current Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share (TTM)
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current market price, trailing 12-month earnings per share
- **Excluded**: Extraordinary items, one-time gains/losses
- **Unit**: Multiple (times)
- **Frequency**: Updated daily with market price changes

## Interpretation
| P/E Range | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| < 10 | Potentially undervalued, value opportunity |
| 10 - 15 | Fairly valued, reasonable price |
| 15 - 25 | Moderately expensive, growth expectations |
| 25 - 40 | Expensive, high growth expectations |
| > 40 | Very expensive, speculative pricing |

## Example
If a stock has:
- Current Price: ₹1,000
- Earnings per Share: ₹50
- P/E Ratio = 1,000 / 50 = 20x

## Advantages
- Easy to understand and calculate
- Widely used by investors
- Good for comparing companies
- Indicates market expectations
- Useful for valuation analysis

## Limitations
- Doesn't account for growth rates
- Can be misleading for cyclical companies
- Doesn't consider debt levels
- May not reflect true earnings quality
- Can be manipulated through accounting

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: Generally lower P/E due to regulatory constraints
- **Technology**: Often higher P/E due to growth expectations
- **FMCG**: Generally stable, moderate P/E
- **Manufacturing**: Varies significantly by cycle

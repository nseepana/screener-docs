# Price to Quarterly Earning [Qtr P/E]

The Price to Quarterly Earning ratio calculates the P/E ratio based on the latest quarterly earnings annualized, providing a more current valuation metric compared to trailing twelve months.

## Formula
```text
Quarterly P/E = Current Price / (Latest Quarterly EPS × 4)
```

## Components
- **Included**: Current price, latest quarterly EPS
- **Excluded**: Previous quarters' earnings, extraordinary items
- **Unit**: Multiple (times)
- **Frequency**: Updated quarterly with earnings results

## Interpretation
| Quarterly P/E | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------------|
| < 10 | Potentially undervalued |
| 10 - 15 | Fairly valued |
| 15 - 25 | Moderately overvalued |
| 25 - 35 | Overvalued |
| > 35 | Significantly overvalued |

## Example
If a company has:
- Current Price: ₹1,000
- Latest Quarterly EPS: ₹25
- Quarterly P/E = 1,000 / (25 × 4) = 10

## Advantages
- More current than annual P/E
- Easy to calculate and understand
- Good for comparing companies
- Shows recent performance
- Useful for trend analysis

## Limitations
- Can be volatile
- Doesn't account for seasonality
- May not reflect full year performance

- Doesn't consider growth prospects

## Industry Considerations
- **Technology**: Generally higher due to growth expectations
- **Banking**: Often lower due to regulatory constraints

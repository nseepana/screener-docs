# Promoter Holding [Prom. Hold.]

The Promoter Holding represents the percentage of shares held by the company's promoters (founders, management, and their associates), indicating the level of insider ownership and alignment of interests.

## Formula
```text
Promoter Holding = (Promoter Shares / Total Outstanding Shares) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Shares held by promoters, total outstanding shares
- **Excluded**: Employee stock options, treasury shares
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated quarterly with shareholding filings

## Interpretation
| Promoter Holding | Interpretation |
|------------------|----------------|
| > 50% | High promoter control, strong alignment |
| 30% - 50% | Moderate promoter control, good alignment |
| 20% - 30% | Low promoter control, moderate alignment |
| 10% - 20% | Very low promoter control, weak alignment |
| < 10% | Minimal promoter control, potential misalignment |

## Example
If a company has:
- Promoter Shares: 25 crores
- Total Outstanding Shares: 100 crores
- Promoter Holding = (25 / 100) × 100 = 25%

## Advantages
- Shows management alignment
- Indicates promoter confidence
- Good for governance analysis
- Shows ownership concentration

## Limitations

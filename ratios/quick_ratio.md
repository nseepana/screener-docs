# Quick Ratio [Quick Rat]

The Quick Ratio measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations using its most liquid assets, providing a more conservative view of liquidity than the current ratio.

## Formula
```text
Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
```

## Components
- **Included**: Cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, current liabilities
- **Excluded**: Inventory, prepaid expenses, long-term assets
- **Unit**: Multiple (times)
- **Frequency**: Updated quarterly with financial results

## Interpretation
| Quick Ratio | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| > 2.0 | Excellent liquidity, very safe |
| 1.5 - 2.0 | Good liquidity, comfortable position |
| 1.0 - 1.5 | Adequate liquidity, acceptable |
| 0.5 - 1.0 | Poor liquidity, potential concerns |
| < 0.5 | Very poor liquidity, high risk |

## Example
If a company has:
- Current Assets: ₹100 crores
- Inventory: ₹30 crores
- Current Liabilities: ₹50 crores
- Quick Ratio = (100 - 30) / 50 = 1.4

## Advantages
- More conservative than current ratio
- Excludes less liquid inventory
- Good for short-term analysis
- Easy to calculate and understand
- Useful for credit analysis

## Limitations
- May be too conservative
- Doesn't account for credit terms
- May not reflect true liquidity
- Can vary by industry
- Doesn't consider cash flow timing

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: Generally higher due to liquid assets
- **Technology**: Often higher due to low inventory
- **Manufacturing**: Generally lower due to high inventory
- **Retail**: Varies significantly by business model

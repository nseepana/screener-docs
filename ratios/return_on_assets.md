# Return on Assets [ROA 12M]

Return on Assets (ROA) measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit, indicating the effectiveness of asset utilization in creating value.

## Formula
```text
ROA = (Net Profit / Average Total Assets) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Net profit after tax, average total assets
- **Excluded**: Extraordinary items, minority interests
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated quarterly with financial results

## Interpretation
| ROA Range | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| > 10% | Excellent asset efficiency, high profitability |
| 5% - 10% | Good asset efficiency, above average |
| 2% - 5% | Average asset efficiency, acceptable |
| 0% - 2% | Below average, needs improvement |
| < 0% | Poor asset efficiency, losses |

## Example
If a company has:
- Net Profit: ₹50 crores
- Average Total Assets: ₹1,000 crores
- ROA = (50 / 1,000) × 100 = 5%

## Advantages
- Measures asset efficiency
- Easy to compare across companies
- Shows management effectiveness
- Good for operational analysis
- Less affected by capital structure

## Limitations
- Can be affected by asset valuation
- Doesn't account for risk
- May not reflect cash generation
- Can be manipulated through asset sales
- Doesn't consider growth prospects

## Industry Considerations
- **Banking**: Generally lower ROA due to high asset base
- **Technology**: Often higher ROA due to low asset intensity
- **FMCG**: Generally stable, moderate ROA
- **Manufacturing**: Varies significantly by efficiency

# Return on Equity [ROE]

Return on Equity (ROE) measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested, indicating the efficiency of capital utilization.

## Formula
```text
ROE = (Net Profit / Average Shareholders' Equity) × 100
```

## Components
- **Included**: Net profit after tax, average shareholders' equity
- **Excluded**: Extraordinary items, minority interests
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated quarterly with financial results

## Interpretation
| ROE Range | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| > 20% | Excellent profitability, efficient capital use |
| 15% - 20% | Good profitability, above average |
| 10% - 15% | Average profitability, acceptable |
| 5% - 10% | Below average, needs improvement |
| < 5% | Poor profitability, inefficient capital use |

## Example
If a company has:
- Net Profit: ₹100 crores
- Average Shareholders' Equity: ₹500 crores
- ROE = (100 / 500) × 100 = 20%

## Advantages
- Measures profitability efficiency
- Easy to compare across companies
- Widely used by investors

## Limitations

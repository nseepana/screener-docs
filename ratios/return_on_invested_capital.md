# Return on Invested Capital [ROIC]

The Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) measures the efficiency of capital allocation by calculating the return generated from core business operations on the total invested capital.

## Formula
```text
ROIC = (NOPAT / Invested Capital) × 100
Invested Capital = Net Block + Working Capital
```

## Components
- **Included**: NOPAT, net block, working capital
- **Excluded**: Non-operating income, extraordinary items
- **Unit**: Percentage (%)
- **Frequency**: Updated quarterly with financial results

## Interpretation
| ROIC Range | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| > 15% | Excellent capital allocation |
| 10 - 15% | Good capital allocation |
| 5 - 10% | Average capital allocation |
| 0 - 5% | Poor capital allocation |
| < 0% | Very poor capital allocation |

## Example
If a company has:
- NOPAT: ₹150 crores
- Net Block: ₹800 crores
- Working Capital: ₹200 crores
- ROIC = (150 / (800 + 200)) × 100 = 15%

## Advantages

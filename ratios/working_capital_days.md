# Working Capital Days [WC Days]

The Working Capital Days measures the number of days of sales that are tied up in working capital (excluding cash), indicating the efficiency of working capital management and cash conversion.

## Formula
```text
Working Capital Days = ((Working Capital - Cash) / Annual Sales) × 365
```

## Components
- **Included**: Working capital, cash, annual sales
- **Excluded**: Long-term assets, long-term liabilities
- **Unit**: Days
- **Frequency**: Updated quarterly with financial results

## Interpretation
| WC Days Range | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------------|
| < 30 days | Excellent working capital efficiency |
| 30 - 60 days | Good working capital efficiency |
| 60 - 90 days | Average working capital efficiency |
| 90 - 120 days | Poor working capital efficiency |
| > 120 days | Very poor working capital efficiency |

## Example
If a company has:
- Working Capital: ₹300 crores
- Cash: ₹100 crores
- Annual Sales: ₹1,200 crores
- WC Days = ((300 - 100) / 1,200) × 365 = 60.8 days
